making a change from command line:
check you're in the right folder
type git add . (add everything)
type git commit -m "any comment (string)" 
type git push


upload website for the first time:
create new repository 
copy https link (ends in .git)
go to terminal and navigate to the folder with the stuff you want to upload
use ls (list current directory) and cd (folder name) to change directory to the folder you want to 
git init 
git add . 
git status (shows status of files in the folder)
git commit -m "any comment" 
git remote add origin (https link) 
git config http.postBuffer 524288000 (maybe if this error occurs:
RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400) 
git push --set-upstream origin main

all changes are pushed to git when you don't see a "U" or "M" or "A" next to your files 
check github repository if your commit message showed up 
if git status shows red, means you forgot git add
if it shows green, did not commit
